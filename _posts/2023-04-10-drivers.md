[Cisco Webex Audio Driver Package](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/WBX9000031110/Cisco-Webex-Audio-Driver-Package-Download-for-Mac) was required and is pushed out via a configuration profile to allow permissions for end-users specifically in the classroom for teachers to share their screen with audio.

[Configuration Profile (Meetings)](/jaysinghdevs/mobileconfig/Webex Meetings Permissions.mobileconfig)

### Wacom
#### Wacom Driver

This is pushed out to all studio arts classes, open labs, and the library. They are a self-service option for other devices.
