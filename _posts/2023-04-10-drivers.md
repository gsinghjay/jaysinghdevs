### Drivers

There are three drivers I have to worry about keeping up to date in my higher education environment.

1. Zoom
  * Zoom Audio Driver
2. Webex
  * Cisco Webex Meetings Audio Driver
3. Wacom
  * Wacom Driver

[Cisco Webex Audio Driver Package](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/WBX9000031110/Cisco-Webex-Audio-Driver-Package-Download-for-Mac) is mandatory for audio to be shared while screen sharing. If professors are having trouble sharing their sound over Webex, it's most likely this package needs to be updated. As of the time of this post, there is no way to automatically update this driver.

### Wacom

This is pushed out to all studio arts classes, open labs, and the library. They are a self-service option for other devices.
