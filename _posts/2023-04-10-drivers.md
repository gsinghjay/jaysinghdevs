### Zoom
#### Zoom Audio Driver
[![Driver Policies](/jaysinghdevs/images/policies_cat_drivers_zoom.png)](https://gsinghjay.github.io/jaysinghdevs/images/policies_cat_drivers_zoom.png)

Script for Zoom Audio Driver:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
cp -R /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/PlugIns/ZoomAudioDevice.driver /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/
sudo killall coreaudiod
```

This is mandatory for audio to be shared while screen sharing. If professors are having trouble sharing their sound over Zoom, the Zoom application itself must be updated as the audio driver lives within the contents of the application.

[![Driver Policies](/jaysinghdevs/images/policies_cat_drivers_webex.png)](https://gsinghjay.github.io/jaysinghdevs/images/policies_cat_webex.png)

[Cisco Webex Audio Driver Package](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/WBX9000031110/Cisco-Webex-Audio-Driver-Package-Download-for-Mac) is mandatory for audio to be shared while screen sharing. If professors are having trouble sharing their sound over Webex, it's most likely this package needs to be updated. As of the time of this post, there is no way to automatically update this driver.

This is pushed out to all studio arts classes, open labs, and the library. They are a self-service option for other devices.
