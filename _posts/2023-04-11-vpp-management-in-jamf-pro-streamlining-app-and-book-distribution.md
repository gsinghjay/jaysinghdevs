3. **User assignment**: Jamf Pro allows admins to assign VPP content to users based on user groups, ensuring the right users have access to the appropriate apps and books.

4. **Device assignment**: VPP content can also be assigned to devices, enabling organizations to manage apps and books on a device level without user interaction.

5. **Reporting**: Jamf Pro provides reports on VPP content usage and license allocation, helping organizations monitor and optimize their app and book distribution.
